# PSYCH-119D
Biological Neural Networks in Matlab 
The codes are done solely by the student (me) and verified by professor.
Week 2: Simulating a jump flee reflex in linear decision boundary from photoreceptor images of a fly using varying photons levels and decision.
Week 3: Horizontal/Veritcal Bar image training and linear regression model. Evaluating performance using predetermined photoreceptor levels and weights. Also applied in cases with logistic classifier settings.
Week 6: CNN networks of a cat, alternating kernel values of -1 to 1, and apply them through varying layers and ReLu functions.
Week 7: discovering model VAE on MNIST images and evaluating varying methods of VAE that effects convergence and digit appearance. Compared with interleaving and catastrophic inference cases.
